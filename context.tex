The implementation of our approach to reproducibility
is focused on the Binder and Jupyter projects,
which are presented here at a high level.
In particular, we focus on the \textbf{Binder tools}
for \textbf{reproducible software environments}.
In this section, we introduce key components of Project Jupyter and Binder to help
contextualise the work we plan to do,
as well as some terminology

\paragraph*{Relationship between \TheProject and Jupyter, Binder}

Several \TheProject team members have a track record as
developers and contributors to Project Jupyter, Binder and its associated
ecosystem, including two current and founding members of the Jupyter Steering Committee,
and the leader of the Binder subproject.
The proposed work has the potential to improve the reproducibility of almost all computational research,
not just those that choose to use notebooks.

}

\begin{terminology}{}
For clarity, we define some terms that have been used
throughout this proposal. We illustrate the terms in the context of the
reproducibility example in \nameref{sec:reproducibility-example}.

\begin{description}
\item[Repository] We refer to a \emph{repository} as a collection of files.

The \emph{purpose} of the repository in our context is to collect/archive/transport information to make
research results reproducible.
Such a repository could be a \softwarename{git} repository (hosted on GitHub or other services),
but it could also be a simple zip file.
A repository typically contains some of these items:

\begin{compactitem}
  \item \textbf{Documentation}
  \item \textbf{Script}
  \item \textbf{Software specification}
  \item \textbf{Data}
\end{compactitem}

The repository could be made publicly available,
for example through Zenodo
as an electronic supplementary to a publication,
or through GitHub.

\item[Script] A machine-executable file (for example a Bash, Python, Perl
script, Makefile or similar). Such scripts can execute data processing commands,
and are often part of a repository to make the (automatic) reproduction of
results possible.

In our example, the necessary steps to create the figure from the raw data are
gathered in the notebook \texttt{figure1.ipynb}.

\item[Software specification] A description of what software is needed to run the \textbf{Script}.
  Ideally, but \emph{not necessarily} machine readable.
  The exact form of the software specification depends on the software tools used.
  In our example, a \texttt{requirements.txt} file indicates the \softwarename{pip} tool is used.

\item[Software environment] All the software that needs to be available and
  installed to execute the scripts and (and if desired) Jupyter notebooks.
  This is generally produced from the \textbf{Software specification}.
