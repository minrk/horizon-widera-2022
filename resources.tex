\TOWRITE{}{How much justification necessary?}

\eucommentary{
Please complete the table below for each participant if the purchase costs (i.e.
the sum of the costs for 'travel and subsistence', 'equipment', and `other
goods, works and services') exceeds 15\% of the personnel costs for that
participant (according to the budget table in proposal part A). The record must
list cost items in order of costs and starting with the largest cost item, up to
the level that the remaining costs are below 15\% of personnel costs
}

\paragraph*{Purchase costs} All participants request less than 15\% of personnel costs in purchase costs.
These costs enable our work plan through supporting: 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item project meetings
\item site visits between project members to foster collaboration
\item conference attendance for dissemination
\item open access publication fees
\item communication activities
\item equipment for carrying out the work (high performance laptop computers for each FTE)
\item hosting workshops for dissemination (in budget of lead site \site{SRL})
\item cloud computing costs for testing outputs and supporting development and workshops (\site{SRL} budget)
\item CFS (\site{SRL} only)
\TOWRITE{}{needs to be discussed earlier in work plan}
\end{itemize}

% \site{SRL} is the only site requesting more than 15\% of personnel costs in purchase costs.
% This is because \site{SRL} will host some shared project-wide costs,
% such as hosting workshops for \WPref{education}
% and project-wide cloud costs for testing and demonstration,
% used across all work packages.
%
% % Our project travel costs are estimated based on:
% %
% \begin{compactenum}
% \item 800 \euro per traveller for each of 3 project meetings
% \item 2000 \euro per FTE-researcher-year (1.75) for site visits, facilitating collaboration
% \item 3000 \euro per FTE-researcher-year (1.75) for conference attendance
% \item 4000 \euro for hosting each of two in-person workshops,
%       with an estimated cost of 400 \euro per participant (10 participants).
