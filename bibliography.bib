 abstract = {
        A persistent challenge in materials science is the characterization of a large ensemble of heterogeneous nanostructures in a set of images. This often leads to practices such as manual particle counting, and sampling bias of a favorable region of the “best” image. Herein, we present the open-source software, imaging criteria and workflow necessary to fully characterize an ensemble of SEM nanoparticle images. Such characterization is critical to nanoparticle biosensors, whose performance and characteristics are determined by the distribution of the underlying nanoparticle film. We utilize novel artificial SEM images to objectively compare commonly-found image processing methods through each stage of the workflow: acquistion, preprocessing, segmentation, labeling and object classification. Using the semi- supervised machine learning application, Ilastik, we demonstrate the decomposition of a nanoparticle image into particle subtypes relevant to our application: singles, dimers, flat aggregates and piles. We outline a workflow for characterizing and classifying nanoscale features on low-magnification images with thousands of nanoparticles. This work is accompanied by a repository of supplementary materials, including videos, a bank of real and artificial SEM images, and ten IPython Notebook tutorials to reproduce and extend the presented results.

    The data, code, and figure outputs for my work re-examining the claims of Badruddin & Aslam (2015) , hereafter BA15, titled "Influence of cosmic ray variability on the monsoon rainfall and temperature", published in JASTP.

    This work reproducibly demonstrates the errors in BA15, and explains why their conclusions (of a solar link to the Indian monsoon intensity) are not supported by their analysis.

	abstract = {Bringing HEP computing to HPC can be difficult. Software stacks are often very complicated with numerous dependencies that are difficult to get installed on an HPC system. To address this issue, NERSC has created Shifter, a framework that delivers Docker-like functionality to HPC. It works by extracting images from native formats and converting them to a common format that is optimally tuned for the HPC environment. We have used Shifter to deliver the CVMFS software stack for ALICE, ATLAS, and STAR on the supercomputers at NERSC. As well as enabling the distribution multi-TB sized CVMFS stacks to HPC, this approach also offers performance advantages. Software startup times are significantly reduced and load times scale with minimal variation to 1000s of nodes. We profile several successful examples of scientists using Shifter to make scientific analysis easily customizable and scalable. We will describe the Shifter framework and several efforts in HEP and NP to use Shifter to deliver their software on the Cori HPC system.}

  abstract     = {Jupyter notebooks are executable documents that are displayed in a web browser. The notebook elements consist of human-authored contextual elements and computer code, and computer-generated output from executing the computer code. Such outputs can include tables and plots. The notebook elements can be executed interactively, and the whole notebook can be saved, re-loaded and re-executed, or converted to read-only formats such as HTML, LaTeX and PDF. Exploiting these characteristics, Jupyter notebooks can be used to improve the effectiveness of computational and data exploration, documentation, communication, reproducibility and re-usability of scientific research results. They also serve as building blocks of remote data access and analysis as is required for facilities hosting large data sets and initiatives such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In this contribution we report from our experience of using Jupyter notebooks for data analysis at research facilities, and outline opportunities and future plans.},

By default, JupyterHub uses the local system users and PAM authentication, but it can be customized to use any authentication system, including GitHub, CILogon, Shibboleth, and more. The way single-user servers are spawned can also be customized to use services such as Docker, Kubernetes, or HPC cluster queuing systems. The tutorial will cover a basic deployment of JupyterHub on a single machine, then extending it to use docker and GitHub authentication, as well as general best practices for JupyterHub deployment.},
