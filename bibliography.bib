 abstract = {
        A persistent challenge in materials science is the characterization of a large ensemble of heterogeneous nanostructures in a set of images. This often leads to practices such as manual particle counting, and sampling bias of a favorable region of the “best” image. Herein, we present the open-source software, imaging criteria and workflow necessary to fully characterize an ensemble of SEM nanoparticle images. Such characterization is critical to nanoparticle biosensors, whose performance and characteristics are determined by the distribution of the underlying nanoparticle film. We utilize novel artificial SEM images to objectively compare commonly-found image processing methods through each stage of the workflow: acquistion, preprocessing, segmentation, labeling and object classification. Using the semi- supervised machine learning application, Ilastik, we demonstrate the decomposition of a nanoparticle image into particle subtypes relevant to our application: singles, dimers, flat aggregates and piles. We outline a workflow for characterizing and classifying nanoscale features on low-magnification images with thousands of nanoparticles. This work is accompanied by a repository of supplementary materials, including videos, a bank of real and artificial SEM images, and ten IPython Notebook tutorials to reproduce and extend the presented results.

    The data, code, and figure outputs for my work re-examining the claims of Badruddin & Aslam (2015) , hereafter BA15, titled "Influence of cosmic ray variability on the monsoon rainfall and temperature", published in JASTP.

    This work reproducibly demonstrates the errors in BA15, and explains why their conclusions (of a solar link to the Indian monsoon intensity) are not supported by their analysis.

	abstract = {Bringing HEP computing to HPC can be difficult. Software stacks are often very complicated with numerous dependencies that are difficult to get installed on an HPC system. To address this issue, NERSC has created Shifter, a framework that delivers Docker-like functionality to HPC. It works by extracting images from native formats and converting them to a common format that is optimally tuned for the HPC environment. We have used Shifter to deliver the CVMFS software stack for ALICE, ATLAS, and STAR on the supercomputers at NERSC. As well as enabling the distribution multi-TB sized CVMFS stacks to HPC, this approach also offers performance advantages. Software startup times are significantly reduced and load times scale with minimal variation to 1000s of nodes. We profile several successful examples of scientists using Shifter to make scientific analysis easily customizable and scalable. We will describe the Shifter framework and several efforts in HEP and NP to use Shifter to deliver their software on the Cori HPC system.}

By default, JupyterHub uses the local system users and PAM authentication, but it can be customized to use any authentication system, including GitHub, CILogon, Shibboleth, and more. The way single-user servers are spawned can also be customized to use services such as Docker, Kubernetes, or HPC cluster queuing systems. The tutorial will cover a basic deployment of JupyterHub on a single machine, then extending it to use docker and GitHub authentication, as well as general best practices for JupyterHub deployment.},

  abstract = {Supercomputing centers are seeing increasing demand for user-defined software stacks (UDSS), instead of or in addition to the stack provided by the center. These UDSS support user needs such as complex dependencies or build requirements, externally required configurations, portability, and consistency. The challenge for centers is to provide these services in a usable manner while minimizing the risks: security, support burden, missing functionality, and performance. We present Charliecloud, which uses the Linux user and mount namespaces to run industry-standard Docker containers with no privileged operations or daemons on center resources. Our simple approach avoids most security risks while maintaining access to the performance and functionality already on offer, doing so in just 800 lines of code. Charliecloud promises to bring an industry-standard UDSS user workflow to existing, minimally altered HPC resources.},

As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and compute environments.
