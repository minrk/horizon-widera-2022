\TOWRITE{ALL}{Proofread WP 1 Management pass 1}
\begin{draft}
\TOWRITE{PS (Work Package Lead)}{For WP leaders, please check the following (remove items
  once completed)}
\begin{verbatim}
* TODO items (27 March 2022)
- [ ] check links to local deliverables
- [ ] Need data management plan
- [X] do we need an IPR management plan?
      - I don't think so (HF). The IPR management needs to be part of the
        consortium agreement.
- [ ] do we need a Innovation Management Task? It is commented out for now. As
      we are open source all the way through, we don't need to worry about IPR so
      much, and we also don't need to establish a common understanding.
- [ ] have only one data management plan: it should not be hard to decide to
make everything open source. (i.e. get rid of 'draft' plan at M1)
- [ ] update mile stone names so this WP can be completed
- [ ] should we have a \Binder command?
- [ ] Is 'Binder' the right name to refer to? (Should be consistent throughout.)
- [ ] We mention here that all outputs will be open source (technical
      management). This should maybe go elsewhere?
- [ ] should also check with collaborators that they are happy with this.

  The main objective of WP1 is to establish and maintain an effective contract,
  project, and operational management approach ensuring:

 \begin{compactitem}
 \item Timely and successful implementation of the project; including
   administrative and legal coordination
    \item Technical management and quality assurance
    \item Risk and innovation management of the project as a whole; including
      data and IPR management
    \item Smooth communication and interaction with the EC and other interested
      parties
 \end{compactitem}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}
  The project will be managed by Simula, which has extensive experience in
  administering and leading EU funded and national projects. The coordinator
  together with the WP leaders, will be responsible for monitoring WP status,
  coordination of work plan updates and annual internal progress reports.

  id=admin,
  lead=SRL,
  PM=6,
  wphases={0-36!.166},
  partners={MP,QS,UIO,IFR},
]
The task includes the following activities:
\begin{compactenum}
\item Preparation, distribution and maintenance of all contractual documents
  (Consortium Agreement, Grant Agreement and all other legal frameworks)
\item Establishment of appropriate communication and collaborative environment
  for the consortium, as well as the EC and other relevant academic and industry
  stakeholders (the project website, intranet and communication procedures) to
  organise transfer of knowledge, present and promote project results
  (\localdelivref{infrastructure});
\item Organisation of project review and progress meetings;
\item Performing qualitative and quantitative risk analysis, planning risk
  mitigation and control
\item Progress and Financial Reporting to the EC;
\item Data and IPR Management will be managed in accordance with agreed rules
  stated in the Consortium Agreement and in accordance with the Data Management
  Plan (\localdelivref{data-management-plan}.

  id=project-management,
  lead=SRL,
  PM=6,
  wphases={0-36!.166},
  partners={MP,QS,UIO,IFR}
  ]
  The task includes the following activities:
  \begin{compactenum}
\item The scientific and technical management to ensure coherent quality and
  soundness of the work and results.
\item Applying quality assurance measures across all partners for all tasks and
  deliverables.
\item Reporting of outcomes and quality assurance activities in technical
  reports and reviews.
\item The project coordinator, with the help of the work package leads, will
regularly review technological risks and recommend mitigation plans to minimise
or remove them. This will be reported on at each reporting period in the
project's technical report.
\item Set up and maintenance of technical management infrastructure required for
  a software project of this type, such as a web site, open source hosting of code and
  documentation, mailing lists, task trackers, automatic tests and continuous
  integration. We will feed back into existing open source repositories projects
  where they exist already, and make use of commonly used tools and services
  such as GitHub. All outputs will be published under an open source license.

% One of the most important criteria for success for the \TheProject project is to
% bring the project results into use. Therefore, exploitation routes will be
% sought whenever possible. In order to create a common understanding within the
% Consortium of how we can best shepherd an idea all the way from conception to
% realisation and exploitation, the Coordinator will be responsible for the
% preparation and realisation of an Innovation Plan. This plan will assure that
% research activities meet the required milestones and produce outputs fully
% aligned with the project objectives. All research activities will go through an
% initial process where the exploitation opportunity is identified along with the
% main stakeholders for the exploitation opportunity and an IP owner
% (\localdelivref{innovation-management-plan}).

The task includes the following activities:
\begin{compactenum}
\item Form the community engagement panel by inviting representative of relevant
  communities. Ensure that representatives from stakeholder communities include
  current and potential future Binder users.
\item Organise regular (online) community engagement panel meetings, soon after the
  beginning of the project, and subsequently at the end of years 1, 2, and 3.
\item Ensure that input and feedback from community engagement panel members are
  considered to direct the project to improve the usefulness of Binder tools
  and broaden the range of their applicability to maximise overall impact.
\item Encourage and foster voluntary collaboration and direct contributions to
  the project from the communities represented in the community engagement
  panel that go beyond the advisory role of the panel itself.
