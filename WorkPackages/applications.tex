\begin{wpobjectives}
  The objectives of this work package are
 \begin{compactitem}
 \item to guide the development of core tools in \WPref{reproducibility} and \WPref{impact}
   by simultaneously applying them to real-world use cases from various scientific fields
 \item to do this together with active scientists from these fields to ensure we develop tools
   which can cater for a broad European and global research community
 \item to demonstrate how the tools we develop can support more reproducible and
   reusable science
   \end{compactitem}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}

  Whilst the components issued from work packages  \WPref{reproducibility} and \WPref{impact} will be
  made available as generic tools for reproducible open science,
  this work package is focused on using (and if required tailoring) them
  to make them suitable for specific real-world cases, described in \ref{sec:science-applications}.

  The use-cases we anticipate are
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item \localtaskref{demos} Applications and best practice examples that
    demonstrate use of Binder for more reproducible and reusable science.
  \item \localtaskref{binder-at-home} Ability to recreate software environments
    and re-produce results using local compute resources (such as the Desktop of
    a researcher)
  \item \localtaskref{data-publishing} Use of Binder to facilitate access to
    large data sets where the published resource does not only include the data
    itself, but also software to access and read the data.
  \item \localtaskref{binder-at-hpc} Use of Binder at High Performance Computing
    facilities to re-produce computationally more demanding results
  \end{compactitem}

%   \TOWRITE{}{Edit this paragraph:}
%   The context and vision for each of the demonstrators is described in
%   section \ref{sec:science-demonstrators-in-concept} on page
%   \pageref{sec:science-demonstrators-in-concept}.

  Working collaboratively with core Binder developers and research active
  scientists, we merge state-of-the-art knowledge on what is technically
  possible with the understanding of the scientists what reproducibility
  features would significantly improve their workflow. We expect that -- in
  addition to iteratively refining the features of Binder -- we will also
  inspire each other to find out-of-the box solutions that each group on
  their own may not come to think about.

  %\medskip

  % The particular workflows, data infrastructures, data policies, and data access
  % protocols for
  % FAIR\footnote{Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable} sharing of data vary from one community and use-case to
  % the other, and may not be fully defined yet. Therefore, this proposal
  % does not enforce a specific way of handling data. Instead we
  % will explore in the demonstrator tasks how existing data policies,
  % infrastructure and workflows can be respected and integrated with
  % authentication and authorisation, data management, and
  % Binder services. EGI is represented in our Community Engagement Panel (\taskref{management}{community-engagement-panel})
  % for all the tasks in this work package and will work with us to find the
  % best integration solutions in the evolving EOSC infrastructure.

  \medskip

  The tasks in this work package are progressed throughout the runtime of the
  project, serving both as requirements capture (and so to inform and guide the
  work in \WPref{reproducibility} and \WPref{impact}) and evaluation of the
  technological advances of the Binder tools.

  We will use the regular technical reports to update on progress. An
  interim \localdelivref{report-use-cases-interim} and final
  report will summarise the results (\localdelivref{report-use-cases}).
  Documentation of best practice guideliness will be developed as an open
  document throughout the project, used in \WPref{education}, and be submitted
  as deliverable at the end of the project~(\delivref{education}{best-practice-guide}).
