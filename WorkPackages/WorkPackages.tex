% Note: in the grant agreement, The workpackage description must not appear.
% Yet we want to compile them to get all the metadata right
% Current hack: compile them anyway, reset the page number
% appropriately, and remove them a posteriori with pdftk. We set the
% color to red to make it more visible in case we forget to remove
% them.
% See grantagreement rule in the Makefile
\newcounter{savepage}
\setcounter{savepage}{\value{page}}
\color{red} % To make sure we indeed remove the pages
