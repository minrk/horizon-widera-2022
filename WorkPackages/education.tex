  A key focus of this work package is to disseminate the results of this
  project, including the technical advances and guidance for best practice for
  reproducible science. This includes educating researchers about the value of
  open science, reproducibility and re-usability as well as the possibilities of
  integrating Binder tools in their workflows.

  Beyond this activity, which is directed from the project members to the wider community of
  scientists, we use this work package to engage with researchers and
  stakeholders and seek input from them to the project. Desired input includes
  requirements for practical reproducibility in the different domain as well as
  technical contributions -- for example through merge requests for Binder
  tools, or open source documentation of best practice for reprocudible software
  environments. Strong collaboration with the Community Engagement Panel is expected to take place.

  Our dissemination, education and engagement objectives includes:
 \begin{compactitem}
   \item Ensure awareness of the results of the project in the user community,
     and in particular in those groups that act as educators and multipliers of
     knowldege (such as the Carpentries and research infrastructure organisations).
   \item Educate the community on the value of open science, and in particular
   \item train researchers in best practices for open and reproducible science.
   \item Produce and training and education material to disseminate the ability to
     publish reproducible computational science outputs using the tools we
     improve and develop.
   \item Address the shortage of researchers and research support staff trained
     in practical reproducibility.
   \item Provide documentation and tutorials which can serve as the technical
     components of reproducibility policies.
   \item Throughout these activities engage with users and stakeholders, to
     listen and understand their barriers or incentives towards more
     reproducible science, and the usability of the \TheProject outputs.

\begin{wpdescription}

  Open science and reproducible science is entirely dependent on researchers
  adopting open practices. 

  We address this challenge in multiple ways:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The philosophy of the Binder tools is to respect existing standards and
    best practice (and not to invent additional syntax or requirements). It is
    thus possible to use the Binder tools (to recreate a software environment)
    even if the repository authors did not anticipate the use of Binder, or knew
    about their existence. In the best possible scenario, a scientific research
    output becomes automatically reproducible with Binder without the
    \emph{author having to know about Binder or having to invest additional
      effort} (beyond following best practice).

    \item In this work package, we produce education materials and carry out
      education activities to spread the knowledge about \emph{good practice for
        reproducibility and re-usability in science}, such as for example
      automation of all analysis steps, and complete documentation of the
      required software stack. Only one aspect of this training is to show how
      Binder can help with reproducibility.

    \item Throughout the activities of this project and the engagement with the
      wider science community through the Community Engagement Panel, we aim to understand 
      the underlying drivers for
      acceptance, rejection or lack-of-interest in adopting practices that lead
      to reproducible science results.
  \end{enumerate}

  % HF: I think training the wider (non-scientist) public about Binder is going
  % too far?
  %
  % Going further, it is also clear that open science is not just of value
  % to researchers: one of the largest benefits of open science is that it makes
  % science accessible to the broader public who may not be members of the
  % research community.
  %
  % To this end, in addition to training researchers, we will also train the
  % public in how to make use of the open science research and services
  % facilitated by \TheProject. This will be done through regular open
  % dissemination and training workshops, as well as by producing and maintaining
  % material for online courses and documentation.

  Science applications ()\WPref{applications}) will also support the creation
   of tutorials and \emph{best practice guides for
    reproducibility} (\localtaskref{online-resources}), and
  offer interactive (online, hybrid and/or in-person) workshops (\localtaskref{workshops}) 
  to help disseminate the content more effectively.

  We will also participate in the well established academic dissemination
  activities, and events of the European e-infrastructure projects and other
  relevant structures. EGI is a member of our the community engagement panel
  (\taskref{management}{community-engagement-panel}) and the interaction with
  them will be useful to prioritise our resources in this very active field.
