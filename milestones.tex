\subsubsection{Milestones}\label{sec:milestones}

\eucommentary{Milestones means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may
correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin.
They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective
measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for
example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further
development.

  \milestone[
    id=study,
    month=12,
    wps={reproducibility},
    verif={Report produced.},
    ]
  {Reproducibility study}
  {
  We will have preliminary study results to guide and evaluate
  improvements to reproducibility with \TheProject tools,
  and inform best tractices.
  }
  \milestone[
    id=conda-time,
    month=6,
    wps={reproducibility},
    verif={},
    ]
  {Conda time machine}
  {
  The conda/mamba package manager shall be able to
  select packages for installation based on a given date
  }

  \milestone[
    id=repo2docker-time,
    month=18,
    wps={reproducibility},
    verif={Feature present in repo2docker software},
    ]
  {repo2docker takes publication time into account}
  {
  }

  \milestone[
    id=repo2docker-improved,
    month=24,
    wps={reproducibility},
    verif={Comparative study},
    ]
  {repo2docker produces robust computational environments}
  {
  Taking input from earlier study and tests,
  improvements to repo2docker are made.
  }

  \milestone[
    id=rm-kubernetes,
    month=9,
    wps={impact,applications},
    verif={},
    ]
  {BinderHub can be deployed without Kubernetes}
  {
  }

  \milestone[
    id=rm-docker,
    month=15,
    wps={impact,applications},
    verif={},
    ]
  {Support for alternative container technologies in repo2docker for suitability in HPC}
  {
  }

  \milestone[

    wps={applications},
    verif={
      Deployed first functional prototypes of science demonstrators.
      Early users are able to access and test prototype services
    }
    ]
  {Prototype demonstrator services}
  {
  By this point, prototype demonstrator services will be useful and accessible
  to a broad range of users, and we will have begun to experiment with early-adopter
  users and local demonstrators to guide further development of \TheProject,
  ensuring that development serves the reproducibility needs of the global science community.
  }

  \milestone[
    id=docs-online,
    month=12,
    wps={education},
    verif={},
    ]
  {Draft best practices documentation}
  {
  Draft version of documentation for best practices is online
  }
