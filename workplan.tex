\subsubsection{Quality and efficiency of the implementation}\label{sec:workplan-structure}

\ifgrantagreement The \else As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:workpackages}, the \fi work plan is broken down into five work
packages: \WPref{reproducibility} focuses on robustness improvements of the
Binder tools, \WPref{impact} is advancing the Binder tools feature set to
increase the impact of the tools and project, \WPref{applications} applies and
evaluates the reproducibility tools in real-world research contexts.
\WPref{education} is focused on engaging with and educating researchers and the
wider public in best practices for reproducible science. This is complemented by
the usual management work package (\WPref{management}).

    Development of new functionality surrounding Jupyter's Binder tools to improving robustness
    and Broadening impact (WP2, WP3),
    Applications of tools developed in real world research context (WP4),
    and Dissemination, education, and engagement (WP5: Dis., edu., eng.).
