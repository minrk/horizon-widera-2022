\ifgrantagreement The \else As shown in Table~\ref{fig:wplist} and
Figure~\ref{fig:workpackages}, the \fi work plan is broken down into five work
packages: \WPref{reproducibility} focuses on robustness improvements of the
Binder tools, \WPref{impact} is advancing the Binder tools feature set to
increase the impact of the tools and project, \WPref{applications} applies and
evaluates the reproducibility tools in real-world research contexts.
\WPref{education} is focused on engaging with and educating researchers and the
wider public in best practices for reproducible science. This is complemented by
the usual management work package (\WPref{management}).

these work packages.
