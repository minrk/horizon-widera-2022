\subsubsection{Quality and efficiency of the implementation}\label{sec:workplan-structure}

\ifgrantagreement The \else As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:workpackages}, the \fi work plan is broken down into five work
packages: \WPref{reproducibility} focuses on robustness improvements of the
Binder tools; \WPref{impact} is advancing the Binder tools' feature set to
broaden their applicability and increase the impact of the tools and project; \WPref{applications} applies and
evaluates the reproducibility tools in real-world research contexts;
\WPref{education} is focused on engaging with and educating researchers and the
wider public in best practices for reproducible science. This is supported by
the usual management work package (\WPref{management}).

    development of new functionality surrounding Jupyter's Binder tools to improving robustness
    and broadening impact (WP2, WP3),
    applications of tools developed in real-world research context (WP4),
    and dissemination, education, and engagement (WP5: Dis., edu., eng.).

        month for each work packages. We ramp up overall activity during year 1, then
        remain at a constant level. In the beginning of the project, the work on core
        parts of the technology dominates (WP2 and WP3). The activity in application of
