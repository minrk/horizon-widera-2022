\subsubsection{Quality and efficiency of the implementation}\label{sec:workplan-structure}

\ifgrantagreement The \else As shown in Table~\ref{fig:wplist} and
Figure~\ref{fig:workpackages}, the \fi work plan is broken down into five work
packages: \WPref{reproducibility} focuses on robustness improvements of the
Binder tools, \WPref{impact} is advancing the Binder tools feature set to
increase the impact of the tools and project, \WPref{applications} applies and
evaluates the reproducibility tools in real-world research contexts.
\WPref{education} is focused on engaging with and educating researchers and the
wider public in best practices for reproducible science. This is complemented by
the usual management work package (\WPref{management}).

    The relationships and interactions of the work packages,
    broken up into four categories: Management (WP1),
    Development of new functionality surrounding Jupyter's Binder tools to improving robustness
    and Broadening impact (WP2, WP3),
    Applications of tools developed in real world research context (WP4),
    and Dissemination, education, and engagement (WP5: Dis., edu., eng.).

\pagebreak The Gantt chart in
Figure~\ref{fig:gantt} %on page~\pageref{fig:gantt}
illustrates the distribution of time across the work packages over time.
The height of grey bars corresponds to total person month effort per
month for each work packages. We ramp up overall activity during year 1, then remain
at a constant level. In the beginning of the project, the work on core parts of
the technology dominates (WP2 and WP3). The activity in application of the new features (WP4) and dissemination
(WP5) grows over time.
