Developing software that people will use requires maintenance of that
software, not just new development. Through  this proposal we will
contribute general support to open source reproducibility software
where this is helpful for \TheProject. Such contributions are expected 
to the Jupyter (and as sub project) Binder code base. They support not
just all participants in \TheProject but also millions of people
relying on Jupyter software.


% Maintenance of core software is often an implicit and un-paid cost, or one
% hidden in over-describing the resources required to deliver proposed
% developments. In \TheProject, we make it clear and explicit that we will spend a
% significant amount of time developing and maintaining the core Jupyter and
% JupyterHub e-Infrastructure to respond to the needs of \TheProject and others,
% and contribute towards the sustainability and health of the community.
% 
% We will provide support to the Jupyter e-Infrastructure software, ensuring that
% it meets the needs (\localdelivref{jupyter-contributions}) of \TheProject, and
% aid in the release process to ensure that stable releases of Jupyter software
% can be used in mature \TheProject services (\localdelivref{jupyter-releases}).
% 
%   \TheProject will need improvements to core Jupyter functionality, including areas of:
% 
%   \begin{compactenum}
%     \item ease of deployment
%     \item security
%     \item scalability of JupyterHub
%     \item performance
%   \end{compactenum}
% 
%   We will contribute improvements in these areas,
%   meeting the needs of \TheProject and benefiting the wider Jupyter
%   community.
