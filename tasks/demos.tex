\begin{task}[

  In this task, we want to demonstrate the value and usefulness of \WPref{reproducibility} and
  \WPref{impact} with real scientific use cases from the research communities involved in \TheProject.
  The demonstrators are designed to exploit the solutions developed within \TheProject (Binder@Home, Binder@HPC, data publishing)
  and leverage existing institutional and/or national e-infrastructures as well as core EOSC services.
  Synergies between the different science applications and communities will be ensured through the technical tasks (Binder@Home, Binder@HPC, data publishing).
