  The creation of reproducible software environments can take -- depending on
  the complexity and overall size -- some time: generally, an image can be built
  within few minutes, but there are tasks taking much longer.

  In this task, we will optimise the \repotodocker{} performance.

  \TODO{QS - add a little more detail here?}

  \TODO{Mention in which deliverable this will be reported?}
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item ...
    % deliverable will be defined in the appropriate WorkPackage.tex
    % (\localdelivref{deliv-id})
  \end{compactitem}
