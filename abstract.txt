The goals of open science - particularly improved verification and re-use
of research outputs - can only be achieved if reproducibility is an integral
part of the process. Merely available data and code is of drastically less value than
code that can be run easily by anyone. As institutions and organisations increasingly
adopt open and reproducible policies, researchers urgently need tools
to be able to fulfill these requirements in practice. Further, policy makers can benefit from such tools for
evaluation and enforcement of reproducibility policies.
In SOURCE, we address this need and increase the reproducibility of scientific
results by developing such open source tools.

Most research results include a computational component, at least to process
data and create figures for publications.
To reproduce computational results, the software environment in which to execute
the code must be created. Often, this is difficult.
This project will enable researchers to carry out that step automatically. 

We base our work on the Binder tools. Binder aims to automate existing practices for reproducing computational
environments, solving a key piece of practical reproducibility without dictating the
execution workflow itself. Binder is a subproject of Jupyter, which provides open
source tools such as the Jupyter notebook.

Binder has demonstrated its potential for reproducibility in the Jupyter community by serving over ten
million user sessions in the last year at mybinder.org, building over fifty thousand
unique computational environments. We aim to increase the usage by an order of magnitude.

To do this, we will make the Binder tools practically useful outside Jupyter
notebooks and thus for researchers not yet served by them. We will develop
and deliver training on best practices for reproducibility.

We motivate and validate our efforts with selected use cases, such as data
publishing and High Performance Computing (HPC) where Binder tools
are not currently practical.
