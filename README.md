## Prior proposal: BOSSEE

This proposal is adapted from a prior submission, BOSSEE.

BOSSEE is a [proposal](submitted-BOSSEE-2019-01-29.pdf) that was submitted on January
29th 2019 to the H2020 European E-Infrastructure call
[INFRAEOSC-02-2019](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/infraeosc-02-2019) (and which was not funded).


## Focus

In this SOURCE proposal we want to improve reproducibility and re-usability of scientific software, in particular through further development of the [Binder project](https://jupyter.org/binder) and [repo2docker](https://jupyter.org/binder#repo2docker).



## Can I help?

Yes, please. We have many `\TODO` and `\TOWRITE` items scattered in the
document. Merge requests for those are welcome, as is other feedback.

Quick instructions:
