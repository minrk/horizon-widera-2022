## Prior proposal: BOSSEE

This proposal is adapted from a prior submission, BOSSEE.

BOSSEE is a [proposal](submitted.pdf) that was submitted on January
29th to the H2020 European E-Infrastructure call
[INFRAEOSC-02-2019](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/infraeosc-02-2019).


## Focus

In this proposal we want to improve reproducibility and re-usability of scientific software, in particular through further development of the [Binder project](https://jupyter.org/binder) and [repo2docker](https://jupyter.org/binder#repo2docker).


## Work Plan

<!--
## Positions

If accepted (notifications around June) the project will start around
January 2023. and will open about 11 postdoc or research software
engineer positions in our various institutions.
